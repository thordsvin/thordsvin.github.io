The Magistrate of [Winnowing Reach]({{ site.url | append: "/Places/Winnowing_Reach" }}), who has asked the party for assistance in finding a missing researcher [Kenna Brightspark]({{ site.url | append: "/Characters/Kenna_Brightspark" }}). He agreed to write a letter of introduction to the [Birdfolk Council]({{ site.url | append: "/Characters/Birdfolk_Council" }}) and offered 5 gp each for reducing the local slime population. 

After paying the party for their first quest, The Magistrate, decided to withhold his letter of introduction until the party performed a second quest for him. He requested that the party search for an evil witch in [Mokkden Fields]({{ site.url | append: "/Places/Mokkden_Fields" }}) and get rid of her. 

The party presented the amulet that [The Magistrate]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Walden_Krane" }}) asked for as proof but he did not believe their story. [The Magistrate]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Walden_Krane" }}) had sent someone to keep tabs on the party and was well aware the task had not been completed. [The Magistrate]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Walden_Krane" }}) threw the party out of his office and made it clear he never wished to see them ever again.
