A Hedge Druid who has vowed to protect [Bella]({{ site.url | append: "/Characters/Bella"}}) on her adventures. She is accompanied by her companion, Bane Foegnasher

[Bijou Phoenixspine]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bijou_Phoenixspine" }}) found Tender of the Scorched Grove by the name of [Cogburn]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Cogburn" }}). He told her of the work they do and convinced her to join their ranks. [Bijou]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bijou_Phoenixspine" }}) was also looking to formally join a druid's circle and [Cogburn]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Cogburn" }}) was more than happy to lead her into the forests and show the ways of the Circle of the Moon.
