$
\textrm{ Monster Check DC } = 10 + \textrm{ Monster CR } \times 1/2
$

## Encounters and XP
A typical successful day of hunting might break down like this: 
- Searching for information on your target and potential locations. (1 encounter)
- Scouting out area you believe it to be for possible dangers. (1 encounter)
- Tracking your prey to find a good spot to fight it. (1 encounter)
- Avoiding or overcoming dangers along the way (2-4 encounters)
- The Final Hunt (1 encounter)

## Studying
Before Leaving for a hunt, it is wise to gather as much information as you can about your prey. Nature, History, and Arcana can be used search available library for knowledge about the prey. Persuasion could be used to convince an expert to share information with you. Up to 3 checks can be made. The following table outlines results:

| :--: | :------- |
| 0 | The party learns incorrect information and has disadvantage when this information applies. |
| 1 | The party learn 1 piece of information |
| 2 | The Party learns 2 pieces of information |
| 3 | The Party learns atleast 3 pieces of information and has advantage on future checks related to their prey. |


## Scouting
Sending a scout ahead of the party can find potential dangers so the party have a better chance of avoiding them. Only 1 creature can scout an area. Make an Intelligence (investigation) check to find dangers and a Dexterity (stealth) to avoid them.

| Success | 1 danger found |
| For each +5 | 1 additional danger found |
| Failure | disadvantage on the Dexterity(stealth) check |
