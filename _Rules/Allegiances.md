## Tenders of the Scorched grove 
Character are eligible for certain benefits depending on their ranks. There are also certain feats and roles that's are only available at certain ranks. If a character has earned a favor they may spend it to access a benefit from the next rank.
### Seedling
As a seedling, you are taught a ritual which allows you to commune with nature and befriend a minor forest spirit. The forest spirit takes on the form of a Small or Tiny beast of challenge rating 0 of your choice. The forest spirit has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is an elemental, fey, or plant (your choice) instead of a beast.
### Sproutling
You can ask a Tender druid of sapling or higher rank for help with a problem you are currently facing.
### Sapling
When assigned a mission, you can ask a summerblossom to borrow a treasure of the order to help you complete your task. You can choose from among antlers of the true path*, a belt of the weald*, or a ring of animal influence.
### Summerblossom
You are responsible for directing the efforts of lower-ranking members of the  order based on information shared with you by the autumnals. You lead a  team of **2d6** acolytes and **2d4** druids of sapling rank or lower. You are given leave to task these NPCs with specific missions, though any mission you assign must be of relevance to the goals of the order. You may call upon **1d4** acolytes and a druid from among these to assist you directly with a task for the order, but in these situations you are responsible for their safety, and you may be held accountable should anything go wrong.
### Autumnal
You are also appointed to a circle comprised of autumnals who convene regularly to determine the future of your Branch. You are also able to  communicate directly with the treekeeper, wherever their journeys have taken them, using a scroll of sending. The treekeeper may not reply immediately, but they welcome your insights and will reply when they are able.

# Gods and  Piety

A piety check is made by rolling a d20 modified by rank. If you have a usable charm, you may not receive another one. After your diety blesses you, they will not bless you again for 10 days.

| Piety Check | Result |
