## Training
Characters can spend time training skills or learning to use new tools. It takes 10 weeks to train a new profiency. Your intelligence modifer can reduce this time but not raise it. 
Training cost 25 gp per workweek; 10 weeks cost 250 gp.

## Learning Spells
If a character wants to change their learned spells (Bards and Witches specifically) they have 2 options: 
1. Travelling to the Avium: It takes 2 days to travel to the Avium from Alderheart and another 2 travelling back. That leaves 1 day for training in a workweek. The Avium's Library has access to all known spells.
2. If The Ali-Troops decide to build a library and hire an Arcanist's, They will have access to any known spells. If it's not in the library your Arcanist will find it for you.
For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. Additionally, Bella can learn ritual spells from any caster capable of casting the ritual and willing to teach her.

## Recruitment
After a workweek of recruiting, a character stands to make potential recruits. The character makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check using the Carousing table.

| Check Total | Result |
| --: | :-- |
| 1—5 | Character has made a hostile contact. |
| 6—10 | Character has made no new contacts. |
| 11—15 | Character has made an allied contact. |
| 16—20 | Character has made two allied contacts. |
| 21+ | Character has made three allied contacts. |

## Crime
The character must make a series of checks, with the DC for all the checks chosen by the character according to the amount of profit sought from the crime.
To attempt a crime, the character makes three checks: Dexterity (Stealth), Dexterity using thieves' tools, and the player's choice of Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Perception), or Charisma (Deception).

### Loot Value

| DC | Value |
| --: | :-- |
| 10 | 50 gp, robbery of a struggling merchant |
| 15 | 100 gp, robbery of a prosperous merchant |
| 20 | 200 gp, robbery of a noble |
| 25 | 1,000 gp, robbery of one of the richest figures in town |

### Resolution

| Sucesses | Result |
| --: | :-- |
| 0 | the character is caught and jailed. The character must pay a fine equal to the profit the crime would have earned and must spend one week in jail for each 25 gp of the fine. |
| 1 | the heist fails but the character escapes. There are complications though. |
| 2 | the heist is a partial success, netting the character half the payout. |
| 3 | the character earns the full value of the loot. |

## Gaining Renown
Between adventures, a character undertakes minor tasks for the organization and socializes with its members. After pursuing these activities for a combined number of days equal to his or her current renown multiplied by 5, the character's renown increases by 1.

## Gambling
This activity requires one workweek of effort plus a stake of at least 10 gp, to a maximum of 1,000 gp.
The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the competition that the character runs into. Part of the risk of gambling is that one never knows who might end up sitting across the table.
The character makes three checks (1 intelligence, 1 wisdom, 1 charisma): Wisdom (Insight), Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) or Charima (Intimidation), and Intelligence (History) or Intelligence (Investigation). If the character has proficiency with an appropriate gaming set, that tool proficiency can replace the relevant skill in any of the checks or provide advantage. The DC for each of the checks is **5 + 2d10**; generate a separate DC for each one.

| Successes | Value |
| :--: | -- |
| 0 | Lose all the money you bet, and accrue a debt equal to that amount. |
| 1 | Lose half the money you bet. |
| 2 | Gain the amount you bet plus half again more.|
| 3 | Gain double the amount you bet. |

## Performing Sacred Rites
A pious character can spend time between adventures performing sacred rites in a temple affiliated with a god he or she reveres. Between rites, the character spends time in meditation and prayer.

A character who is pious enough and trained to perform sacred rites may perform them; which might include weddings, funerals, and ordinations. A layperson can offer sacrifices in a temple or assist a priest with a rite.
A character who spends at least 10 days performing sacred rites gains inspiration at the start of each day for the next **2d6** days.

## Religious Services
Performing religious service requires access to, and often attendance at, a temple whose beliefs and ethos align with the character's. If such a place is available, the activity takes one workweek of time but involves no gold piece expenditure.
At the end of the required time, the character chooses to make either an Intelligence (Religion) check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check. The total of the check determines the benefits of service.

| Check Total | Result |
| --: | :-- |
| 1—10 | No effect. Your efforts fail to make a lasting impression. |
| 11—20 | You earn one favor. |
| 21+ | You earn two favors. |

##  Work
Performing a job requires one workweek of effort. To determine how much money a character earns, the character makes an ability check appropriate for their chosen work. 

| Check Total | Earnings |
| -- | -- |
| 9 or lower | Poor lifestyle for the week |
| 10—14 | Modest lifestyle for the week |
| 15—20 | Comfortable lifestyle for the week |
| 21+ | Comfortable lifestyle for the week + 25 gp |
