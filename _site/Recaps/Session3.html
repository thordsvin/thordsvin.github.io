<meta name="description" content="Upon arrival at Winnowing Reach our party decided to check out the bookstore and the apothecary. While potions were still a bit too pricey for the party, Bijou Phoenixspine was allowed to use her supplies in the facilities to make some giant spider antivenom. Bella decided she wanted to check the library in the Book Bindery and search for some princess stories. The party also decided to pick up an alcemical recipe book. Next, we were off to the tavern for a rest. While there, the magistrate Walden Krane sent word that he was looking for help from adventurers. He needed help locating a researcher, Kenna Brightspark, who went missing in Mokkden Caverns. As a reward he offered a letter of introduction to the Birdfolk Council and 5 gp for reducing the local slime population. Our party set off, choosing to spend an extra day travelling by road to find a safer entrance to the Caverns. Inside Bella was hit by a crumbling ceiling. When coming up to a bigger opening our party found themselves surrounded by a ground of slimes dropping from the ceiling. After dealing with the slimes, Bella was able to find an intact, but slimy, brass magnifying glass." />
