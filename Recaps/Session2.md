The party agreed to accomplany [[Eliza Pennygleam]] on her journey and protect her wagon. After some discussion it was decided the safest way to travel would be to allow [[Eliza Pennygleam]] to pull her wagon at slow pace, thus allowing the party to sneak through the forest. [[Bella]] Chose to keep [[Eliza Pennygleam]] company to draw attackers towards [[Bella]] instead.  

While Travelling, the party were assaulted by Swarms of Emberbats on the road, a pack of wolves in their camp, and giant spiders.  [[Page]] and [[Bijou Phoenixspine]] dog Bane, were both taken down and poisoned in this fight. Luckily, the spiders poison actually keeps their victims stable so they were able to recover.  

Our stil unnamed party made their way safely to [[Winnowing Reach]] where [[Eliza Pennygleam]] plans to set up for a few days to offload old goods, restock, and find some new wears.
