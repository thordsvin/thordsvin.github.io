The Party returned to [Alderheart]({{site.url | append: "/Places/Alderheart" }}) with from their mission with a letter from [General Benna Seridan]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Benna_Seridan" }}) requesting peace talks. [The Birdfolk Council]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Birdfolk_Council" }}) argued for sometime but still agreeing to a meeting with the Bandit Coalition leader. As a reward for completing their mission, the party was offered a vacant guildhall as their reward. 

They had a week to rest before [General Benna]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Benna_Seridan" }}) would arrive. Most of the party chose to investigate rumors about [The Council]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Birdfolk_Council" }}), but [Bella]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bella" }}) decided to make sure their new guildhall was properly decorated.

There was much fanfare with [General Benna's]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Benna_Seridan" }}) arrival and [Alderheart]({{site.url | append: "/Places/Alderheart" }}) was a buzz with rumors and gossip. The peace talks were a long arduous affair that put some bystanders to sleep. Ultimately, [The Birdfolk Council]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Birdfolk_Council" }}) voted unamisously if favor of peace, partly thanks to [Page's]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Page" }}) persuasive rhetoric.
