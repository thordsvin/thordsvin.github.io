After about 15 minutes spelunking, The party found an opening, where [Kenna Brightspark]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Kenna_Brightspark" }}) could be seen trapped in what appeared to be a rock. As they moved foward to investigate another group of slimes descended from the ceiling and attacked. [Nico]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Nico" }}), not learning his lessons last time, lost another shortsword in a sticky slime. [Page]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Page" }}) cursed the slimes with a Bane spell.
