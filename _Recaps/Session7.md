Packed and ready to go, The Party met up with [Eliza]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Eliza_Pennygleam" }}) and informed her it was time to leave for [Alderheart]({{site.url | append: "/Places/Alderheart" }}). The party decided to travel slowly, much like they did before, sneaking through the forest. Along the way the party was attacked by a swarm of emberbats. After turning into a giant spider, [Bijou]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bijou_Phoenixspine" }}) stuck them together with web and the party easily dealt with this threat. 

The next day, while camping for the night, [Bella]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bella" }}) noticed some odd flickering lights that she couldn't identify. The monsters turned out to be magmin. The party decided to wait til they got closer to attack, but the magmin decided to simply set fire to trees and bushes as they walked down the road. While most of the party climbed down easily, [Page]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Page" }}). She slipped fell from platform 50ft up, but luckily survived. The Magmin were no challenge for the party once they were on the ground, even if they did explode on death. The party was able to rest for a second night before continuing down the road.
