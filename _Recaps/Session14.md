After bringing an end to the fighting between the bandits and [Alderheart]({{site.url | append: "/Places/Alderheart" }}) The Party earned a well deserved rest. This rest gave the party time to spend founding their guild. After much discussion a name was chosen: The Ali-Troops. The emblem of The Ali-Troops features an alicorn to symbolize the unionfication of the birdfolk with the humblefolk. The Ali-Troops also decided the first thing to build would be improvements to the smithy. They also decided to go out and recruit members for the guild. [Bijou Phoenixspine]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bijou_Phoenixspine" }}) asked [Page]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Page" }}) to help her return [Fray Merridan's]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Fray_Merridan" }}) wolf companion and they convinced her to join the guild at a later day when they could afford to pay her to be a beastmaster. [Bella]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bella" }}) went out to recruit a Cervan guard and found a suitable candidate that might make a good captian as well one day. [Page]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Page" }}) was able to find a talented Mapach smith who was interested in joining the guild. And everyone did what they could to raise funds to help get this guildhall running properly.

After a few weeks to rest, The Ali-Troops were called to an emergancy meeting with the Humblewood Council. The Council Chambers were packed and many were upset the Tenders and The Council for not acting quickly enough against a new threat in the woods. The few survivors who made it to [Alderheart]({{site.url | append: "/Places/Alderheart" }}) tried to describe the monster they saw, but their reports were confusing and conflicted with each other. Seeing, The Ali-Troops finally arive, The Council called them over and asked that they go investigate the monster that been attack the Tenders.

So the Ali-Troops set out for the [Scorched Grove]({{site.url | append: "/Places/Scorched_Grove" }}), but along the way they saw a flaming specter. [Page]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Page" }}) cast hideos laughter which caused to fall over laughing uncontrollably. The work so well that the specter was easily put down and laid to rest.
