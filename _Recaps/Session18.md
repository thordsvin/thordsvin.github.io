After opening a sealed door that had been hidden, the Ali-Troops quickly found an old study room. [Mordane Swiftgale]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Mordane_Swiftgale" }}) appeared to be fast asleep but surrounded by a dark grey swirling aura. The party tried very had to wake him but nothing seemed to worked. He was clearly still alive but completely unresponsive. Searching the room uncovered a crystal amulet that could give the wear the appearance of Mordane. Clearly something foul was afoot. 

So the party pushed on to find a door that lead to a classroom. When the party opened the door, the phantom necromancer was nowhere to be found, possibly because the amount of noise the party made to try to wake up [Mordane]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Mordane_Swiftgale" }}). What they had found was a group of skeletons waiting to attack them. The skeletons didn't last long. A quick search of the room told the party they would need to spend some time searching the books and notes strewn about for information, but that could wait. There was a necromancer that had possibly escaped. 

So the Ali-Troops continued down the staircase to a secret laboratory, where they found the necromancer and the hideous monster that scared Figgory Figgins. The party tried to reason with him, but the necromancer wasn't convinced the party was capable enough to execute his plan. So the Ali-Troops attempted to subdue him. But the phantom necromancer was still able to slip away. 

Who was that phantom necromancer? Will the party meet their fate at the hand's on this beady eyed monster? And what was that necromancer's plan for sealing away the aspect of fire and could it work?
