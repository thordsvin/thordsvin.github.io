The party returned to [Winnowing Reach]({{site.url | append: "/Places/Winnowing_Reach" }}) to turn in their quest. The party presented the amulet that [The Magistrate]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Walden_Krane" }}) asked for as proof but he did not believe their story. [The Magistrate]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Walden_Krane" }}) had sent someone to keep tabs on the party and was well aware the task had not been completed. [The Magistrate]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Walden_Krane" }}) threw the party out of his office and made it clear he never wished to see them ever again. 

Seeing a long journey ahead of them, the party decided it would be a good time to prepare and train for the long road ahead to [Alderheart]({{site.url | append: "/Places/Alderheart" }}). Page spent her time honing her craft in The Wrangler's Rest, performing and carrousing the townsfolk. She focused on the nobles in town and found that her party were not the only ones who've had trouble with [The Magistrate]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Walden_Krane" }}). Getting the nobles to discuss their issues together has got them riled up, they're just looking for a reason to storm [The Magistrate's]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Walden_Krane" }}) office. 

[Bella]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bella" }}) received a summons from [Cesar]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Cesar" }}), her unicorn patron. So she snook into the forests alone. [Cesar]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Cesar" }}) told her that he would need her help in the future, but for now, he wanted to prepare her for the journey ahead. [Bella]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bella" }}) learned some new magical abilites and was taught to use telepathy like a unicorn.

[Nico]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Nico" }}) was able to meet up with some old buddies of his. Which was convient timing because he could use their help with some odd jobs. His buddies helped him making a very convincing forgery of the Letter of Introduction that [The Magistrate]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Walden_Krane" }}) would have written. [Nico]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Nico" }}) also attempted to stir up a riot among the townfolk but no one would follow him.

[Bijou Phoenixspine]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bijou_Phoenixspine" }}) found Tender of the Scorched Grove by the name of [Cogburn]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Cogburn" }}). He told her of the work they do and convinced her to join their ranks. [Bijou]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bijou_Phoenixspine" }}) was also looking to formally join a druid's circle and [Cogburn]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Cogburn" }}) was more than happy to lead her into the forests and show the ways of the Circle of the Moon.
