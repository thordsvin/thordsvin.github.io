After cleaning up the mess made by some rogue elementals, The Party continued down the road to [Alderheart]({{site.url | append: "/Places/Alderheart" }}) until they were confronted by highway men demanding a toll for "safe passage." Not willing to pay bandits, [Bella]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bella" }}) used her new telepathic abilities to signal for an attack from the rest of the party. The bandits were overwhelmed quickly, and after being tackled by Bane Foegnasher, the Jerbeen thief in charge begged for his life and offered all the tolls they had collected. The party agreed and let him escape.

The next day on the road, the party saw a warm mist wafting out of the forest. [Bijou Phoenixspine]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bijou_Phoenixspine" }}) was certain this was not a natural phenomenon and convinced to party to investigate. The party came up on a pool filled with Steam Mephits and decided to attack. Bane Fanegnasher seemed to fall in battle but miraculously got back up and away to safety. [Nico]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Nico" }}), after seeing several mephits explode when defeated, decided to test his skill by running up and attacking them with his sword. Somehow his plan worked and he was able to pop the last one while dodging away from the explosion. And so the party continued on to [Alderheart]({{site.url | append: "/Places/Alderheart" }}) to ask the [Birdfolk Council]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Birdfolk_Council" }}) to aid Meadowfen.
