After laying to rest a flaming specter, The Ali-Troops made their way to The Scorched Grove. After a short bit of searching, they found a Tender who was about to be attacked by a burrowing ashsnake. The Tender just manages to wiggle out of the ashsnake's grip as the party preceded to put down this threat. The grateful Tender didn't even have time to thank them as dozens of ashsnakes appeared. But something larger loomed on the horizon, as the ashsnake began to scatter as the earth trembled. A gigantic fire monster approached the party. It seemed to fit the descriptions of the monster Riffin descibed razing Ashbarrow. Unprepared for this fight The Ali-Troops decided to flee and get the Tenders to safety. [Nico]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Nico" }}) fell while trying to escape, but luckily Coco, [Bella's]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bella" }}) fairy friend, was there to make him invisible. Unfortunately, this put Coco too close to the danager and the monster hurled a ball of magma at Coco. Everyone was able to get away to safety and return to [Alderheart]({{site.url | append: "/Places/Alderheart" }}). 

The Humblewood Council was delighted to see The Ali-Troops return with the Tenders safe. The Ali-Troops were finally able to give credible report to The Council, and one member immediately recognized the monster they described. He told them it was an Aspect of Fire, a fearsome monster who hasn't been seen in the Humblewood for many generations. He didn't know of someone at The Avium, Gabe Winsworth, that would know much more and could help them prepare for the fight. For saving the Tenders, the party was awarded with a Feathered Helmet (with a strig feather), and a special requisition letter which entitled the party to 500 GP that can be spent in Alderheart.
