After laying to rest a flaming specter, The Ali-Troops made their way to The Scorched Grove. After a short bit of searching, they found a Tender who was about to be attacked by a burrowing ashsnake. The Tender just manages to wiggle out of the ashsnake's grip as the party preceded to put down this threat. The grateful Tender didn't even have time to thank them as dozens of ashsnakes appeared. But something larger loomed on the horizon, as the ashsnake began to scatter as the earth trembled. A gigantic fire monster approached the party. It seemed to fit the descriptions of the monster Riffin descibed razing Ashbarrow. Unprepared for this fight The Ali-Troops decided to flee and get the Tenders to safety. [Nico]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Nico" }}) fell while trying to escape, but luckily Coco, [Bella's]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Bella" }}) fairy friend, was there to make him invisible. Unfortunately, this put Coco too close to the danager and the monster hurled a ball of magma at Coco. Everyone was able to get away to safety.
