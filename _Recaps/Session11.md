The Party found time to meet with the a legend from the bandit attack named, [Riffin]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Riffin" }}), The Ash Knioght. He was the first survivor from Ashbarrow, that was able to explain what happened there. The Party also found out he was saved by an old friend of his [Odwald Ebonheart]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Odwald_Ebonheart" }}). [Riffin]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Riffin" }}) hasn't seen his friend since that day and refuses to stop searching until he has found his friend. 

The [Birdfolk Council]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Birdfolk_Council" }}) sent guards to find The Party for an immediate summons. The Party was asked to perform a special mission. The Bandit Coalition's stronghold was far up in the Crest Mountains with only one way in. An army could be easily ambushed and forced to retreat. The Party was asked to infiltrate the stronghold to deal with the bandits. There was a lot of argument, but the Party agreed and were named Emmisaries of the Council.

[Riffin]({{site.url | append: "/Characters/Riffin" }}) was convinced to join them and the Party made a stop at the Avium to help him look for his friend. After day of searching the party moved on into the Crest Mountains. When the party got closer to the Stronghold they decided to ambush a supply cart to help them sneak in. The Bandits were easily dispatched and their cart helped with the disguise.
